## üéØ Your Tasks (In Priority Order)

### Task 1: Documents Page Verification (30-45 mins)

**Goal**: Ensure DocumentsScreen works correctly for both sales reps and managers.

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] As sales rep: Can view documents
- [ ] As sales rep: Can download documents offline
- [ ] As manager: Can access DocumentLibrary from Home tab
- [ ] As manager: Can view and download documents
- [ ] All documents showing correctly
- [ ] Offline indicators working

**Files to Check:**
- `mobile/src/screens/DocumentsScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/DocumentLibraryScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/ManageDownloadsScreen.tsx`

**Potential Issues:**
- Manager might not have access to upload documents
- Offline caching might not work for managers
- Design inconsistencies with new headers

**Action**: Test thoroughly, fix any bugs, ensure consistent design.

---

### Task 2: Log Pages Review & Polish (1-1.5 hours)

**Goal**: Review all 3 log entry screens for UX, design consistency, and potential improvements.

**Screens to Review:**
1. **CompactSheetsEntryScreen** (`mobile/src/screens/sheets/CompactSheetsEntryScreen.tsx`)
   - Check header matches dark style
   - Verify catalog selection works
   - Check empty states
   - Test flow: Select catalog ‚Üí Enter count ‚Üí Submit

2. **LogVisitScreen** (`mobile/src/screens/visits/LogVisitScreen.tsx`)
   - Check header matches dark style
   - Verify photo capture works (mandatory counter photo)
   - Check account selection
   - Test purpose dropdown
   - Verify submission works

3. **ExpenseEntryScreen** (`mobile/src/screens/expenses/ExpenseEntryScreen.tsx`)
   - Check header matches dark style
   - Verify category selection
   - Check receipt photo capture (optional)
   - Verify multi-item expense entry
   - Test submission

**Things to Look For:**
- Headers should match dark style (#393735, 24px white title)
- Forms should be clean and easy to use
- Loading states and error handling
- Confirmation/success feedback
- Navigation back to home after submit

**Action**: Make headers consistent, improve UX if needed, test all flows.

---

### Task 3: Minor Enhancements (Optional, if time permits)

**Only if you have time:**

1. **Top Performers Real Data**
   - Modify `functions/src/api/managerStats.ts`
   - Add top performers calculation to `getTeamStats`
   - Sort team members by visits or sheets
   - Return top 3
   - Update `ManagerHomeScreenSimple.tsx` to use real data

2. **Pending Section Styling**
   - Stats page pending approvals section might need design polish
   - Currently shows count + description
   - Could add icons or make more compact

3. **Empty States**
   - Check all empty states are helpful and well-designed
   - Team tab: "No team members yet"
   - Accounts tab: "No accounts found"
   - Review tab: "All DSRs reviewed"

---

## üö® Known Issues to Avoid

### Critical - DO NOT BREAK:
1. **StyleSheet.create at module level** - Don't add theme imports to new files
   - Use inline styles OR
   - Copy pattern from ManagerHomeScreenSimple.tsx (inline styles)

2. **Manager screens with "Simple" suffix** - These work, don't replace them
   - ManagerHomeScreenSimple.tsx
   - TeamScreenSimple.tsx
   - ReviewHomeScreen.tsx
   - AccountDetailScreen.tsx

3. **Navigation** - Role-based routing works, don't change:
   - Managers ‚Üí ManagerTabNavigator
   - Sales reps ‚Üí TabNavigator

### Minor Issues:
- Top performers using sample data (backend calculation needed)
- Some old screen files exist but aren't used (cleanup later)

## üìû Questions You Might Have

**Q: Should I update old manager screens (ManagerHomeScreen.tsx, UserListScreen.tsx)?**
A: No. The "Simple" versions work. Old files can be deleted later.

**Q: The theme system has circular dependency issues?**
A: Yes. Use inline styles for new screens. Don't import theme at module level with StyleSheet.create.

**Q: Can I add new features?**
A: Focus on the tasks listed. If you want to add something, ask the user first.

**Q: Should I start expo/metro servers?**
A: No. User controls when to start/stop servers.

**This session (Oct 16-17) was MASSIVE:**
- Built complete manager dashboard (5 tabs, all functional)
- Standardized design across both dashboards

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Test as both roles** - Manager AND sales rep
2. **Check empty states** - What happens when there's no data?
3. **Test error cases** - What if API fails?
4. **Mobile-first thinking** - Thumb-friendly buttons, clear tap targets
5. **Follow existing patterns** - Don't reinvent, copy what works

**Good luck! The finish line is in sight.** üöÄ

**Session handoff complete. Start with Task 1 (Documents verification), then Task 2 (Log pages), then Task 3 if time.**
