---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION

### 1. DSR Phase 1 Implementation (ALL 4 TASKS COMPLETE ‚úÖ)

Based on your MCQ decisions, all critical DSR improvements are now deployed:

#### Task 1: Pending Sheets Display ‚úÖ
**Status**: Already implemented correctly
**What**: Mobile app sums total sheets from DSR reports (not just counting records)
**Location**: `mobile/src/screens/StatsScreen.tsx` lines 82-94

#### Task 2: DSR Compilation Time ‚Üí 11:59 PM ‚úÖ
**Changed**: `0 23 * * *` ‚Üí `59 23 * * *`
**Result**: DSR now compiles at 11:59 PM IST (was 11:00 PM)
**File**: `functions/src/scheduled/dsrCompiler.ts:211`
**Deployed**: ‚úÖ

#### Task 3: Date Validation (11:59 PM Cutoff) ‚úÖ
**Added validation to 4 API endpoints**:
- `submitExpense` - Blocks new submissions after 11:59 PM
- `updateExpense` - Blocks edits after 11:59 PM
- `logSheetsSale` - Blocks new sales after 11:59 PM
- `updateSheetsSale` - Blocks edits after 11:59 PM

**Logic**:
- **11:59 PM - 11:59:59 PM**: Can only submit/edit for future dates
- **12:00 AM - 5:59 AM**: Grace period - can only edit previous day
- **6:00 AM onwards**: Can submit/edit for today

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/api/expenses.ts` (lines 110-154, 407-451)
- `functions/src/api/sheetsSales.ts` (lines 105-149, 326-371)

**Deployed**: ‚úÖ

#### Task 4: Remove Leads from DSR ‚úÖ
**Removed leads completely from DSR system**:
- Removed `leadIds` from `DailySummary` interface
- Removed leads query from compilation logic
- Removed `leadsContacted` and `leadIds` from `DSRReport` type
- Removed leads from logging statements

**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/scheduled/dsrCompiler.ts`
- `functions/src/types/index.ts:288-298`
- `functions/src/utils/trigger-dsr.ts`

**Deployed**: ‚úÖ

### 2. Stats Screen Enhancements (COMPLETE ‚úÖ)

From earlier in session:

- **Toggle Button Enhancement**:
  - Increased padding, larger text (22px, weight 800)
  - Enhanced shadows and borders
  - Fixed text wrapping with `numberOfLines={1}`
  - Active state with scale effect
- **Target Visibility**:
  - Added red "TARGET" badges
  - Progress bars with target lines at 65%
  - Achievement percentages shown separately
  - Bars capped at 75% (never full)
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - Parallel Firestore queries (17s ‚Üí ~4-5s)
  - getUserStats function optimized
- **Data Fixes**:
  - Attendance calculation (current month vs past month)
  - Expenses format support (items array + single amount)
  - Contractor visits support
  - NaN% bug fixed
- **Permanent Calendar**: Added to attendance tab

**File**: `mobile/src/components/DetailedStatsView.tsx`
**User Feedback**: "ok cool working" ‚úÖ

### 3. Attendance Button Fix (NEW ‚úÖ)

**Problem**: After checking out, "Check In" button was showing immediately (should wait until next day)

**Solution**: Added 3-state logic instead of 2-state:

#### State 1: Not Checked In (Morning)
```
Attendance
Not checked in     [Check In]
```

#### State 2: Checked In (During Work)
```
Working for
3h 45m
Checked in at 9:15 AM
                   [Check Out]
```

#### State 3: Checked Out (Day Complete) ‚ú® NEW
```
Day Complete            ‚úì
Checked out at 6:30 PM
Started at 9:15 AM
```

**Changes Made**:
- Added `hasCheckedOut` and `checkOutTime` to state
- Fetch logic detects if latest attendance is check-out
- Shows "Day Complete" with green checkmark badge (no button)
- Displays both check-in and check-out times
- Resets to "Not checked in" at start of next day

**File**: `mobile/src/screens/HomeScreen_v2.tsx`
**User Request**: "when checked out for the day the attendance box shows checkin button which it shouldn't show until its the next day" ‚úÖ
