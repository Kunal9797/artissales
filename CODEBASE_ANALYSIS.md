### Design System Implementation

**Theme System** (`/mobile/src/theme/`):
- ✅ `colors.ts` - Brand colors + role-based colors
- ✅ `featureColors.ts` - Feature-specific colors (attendance/visits/sheets/expenses)
- ✅ `spacing.ts` - 8px grid system

- ✅ `shadows.ts` - Elevation system
- ✅ `runtime.tsx` - Tenant theming provider
- ✅ `config.ts` - App configuration

**UI Components** (`/mobile/src/components/ui/`):
- 6+ custom components documented in COMPONENT_CATALOG.md
- FlashList integration for performance
- Skeleton, EmptyState, ErrorState patterns

**Pattern Components** (`/mobile/src/components/`):
- `TargetProgressCard.tsx` - Sales target progress
- `VisitProgressCard.tsx` - Visit tracking progress
- `DetailedTargetProgressCard.tsx` - Detailed target view
- Other helper components

**Assessment**: Design system is mature and well-implemented. Only 1 screen (AccountsListScreen) explicitly documented as "exemplar," but design system applied across most screens.

### Naming Inconsistencies & Issues

1. **File Naming**:
   - `HomeScreen_v2.tsx` - Implies older version exists (removed but naming remains)
   - `ManagerHomeScreenSimple.tsx` - "Simple" implies original is complex (workaround for StyleSheet issue)
   - `TeamScreenSimple.tsx` - Similar workaround naming

2. **Duplicate Screens**:
   - `ManagerHomeScreen.tsx` - Original (has StyleSheet issue, unused)
   - `ManagerHomeScreenSimple.tsx` - New version (used in ManagerTabNavigator)
   - Same for TeamScreen variants

3. **Router Mismatch**:
   - RootNavigator imports both old and new manager screens
   - Comment says "Incrementally re-enabling manager stack screens as we test them"
   - Creates confusion about which version is active

**Recommendation**: Clean up by removing unused originals or rename to clarify current/archived status.

## 3. DOCUMENTATION STATE

### Documentation Overview

**Total Files**: 40+ markdown files
**Organization**: 8 categories + 1 root archive

### By Category:

**Design (9 files)** ✅ Well-organized
- Branding guide (logos, colors, brand guidelines)
- Design system v0.1 plan (comprehensive)
- Component catalog (complete API reference)
- Visual direction and design tokens

**Development (6 files)** ✅ Current and helpful
- Firebase usage (critical - modular API standards)
- SDK 54 versions matrix
- Metro troubleshooting guides
- QA summary for DS v0.1

**Implementation (6 files)** ⚠️ Mostly accurate but some inconsistencies
- SALES_REP_COMPLETE.md - Accurate, comprehensive
- MANAGER_DASHBOARD_COMPLETE.md - Accurate, comprehensive
- TABS_IMPLEMENTED.md - Accurate navigation description
- ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT_FINAL_STATUS.md - Good but references navigation not yet updated

**Planning (6 files)** ⚠️ Some outdated, some prescient
- DESIGN_REVAMP.md - October 15 planning doc (design phase, all decisions made since)
- COMPLETE_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md - October 16 (very accurate)
- ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md - October 11 (implemented)
- Other planning docs

**Releases (5 files)** ✅ Good PR templates
- PR5/6 descriptions (design system releases)
- Generic PR template

**Testing (2 files)** ⏳ Basic info
- HOW_TO_TEST.md - Generic testing guide
- PHASE1_PROGRESS.md - Phase 1 testing progress

**Archive (2 files)** ⏳ Historical
- CURRENT_SESSION.md - Old session log
- PROGRESS.md - Historical progress tracker

### Documentation Gaps & Issues

1. **Outdated Planning Docs**:
   - DESIGN_REVAMP.md is from Oct 15 - planning document with "open questions"
   - COMPLETE_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md is from Oct 16 - mostly prescriptive for future
   - Both written as planning documents but should now be "completed" docs

2. **Missing Implementation Docs**:
   - No doc for Offline Documents feature (exists in code)
   - No doc for Design System v0.1 final state (only planning doc exists)
   - No doc explaining StyleSheet issue workaround

3. **Accuracy Issues**:
   - ACCOUNT_MANAGEMENT_FINAL_STATUS.md says "navigation not yet updated" but it is
   - MANAGER_DASHBOARD_COMPLETE.md references sample data as temporary, but no PR/follow-up doc
   - TABS_IMPLEMENTED.md is from Oct 16 but uses old terminology (no mention of manager tabs)

4. **Architecture Docs Missing**:
   - No complete Firestore schema documentation (only in CLAUDE.md)
   - No API contract specifications (only exists in PR descriptions)
   - No deployment guide for Firebase functions
   - No data model migration guide

5. **Code Comments**:
   - RootNavigator has inline comments about re-enabling screens
   - ManagerTabNavigator has TODO comments about unused files
   - Suggests temporary state that wasn't documented

---

## 4. GAPS & DISCREPANCIES

### Major Discrepancies (Code vs Documentation)

**1. Manager Navigation**
- **Documentation Says**: In COMPLETE_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md, proposes split managers into separate TabNavigator
- **Code Does**: Uses single ManagerTabNavigator but with conditional rendering
- **Status**: Documentation proposed Option B, code implements Option A with "Simple" screens workaround

**2. Design System Applied**
- **Documentation Says**: Only AccountsListScreen is exemplar (DS_V0.1_PLAN.md)
- **Code Shows**: Design system applied to most screens already (HomeScreen_v2, StatsScreen, etc.)
- **Status**: Documentation understates implementation

**3. Manager Dashboard**
- **Documentation Says**: Created NEW screens with NEW designs (DESIGN_REVAMP.md)
- **Code Shows**: Screens already exist, some are "Simple" versions due to StyleSheet issues
- **Status**: Documentation written as prescriptive guide, not reflecting implemented state

**4. Offline Documents**
- **Code**: DocumentsScreen.tsx has offline caching (ManageDownloadsScreen.tsx exists)
- **Documentation**: Not mentioned in SALES_REP_COMPLETE.md planning phase docs
- **Status**: Feature exists but hidden from planning narrative

**5. Account Management**
- **Documentation**: Says AddAccountScreen is 95% done, needs navigation setup (Oct 11)
- **Code**: AddAccountScreen exists and appears fully functional
- **Status**: Implementation ahead of documentation

### File Organization Issues

1. **Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - HomeScreen, HomeScreen_v2, HomeScreenNew (only v2 used)
   - ManagerHomeScreen vs ManagerHomeScreenSimple
   - TeamScreen vs TeamScreenSimple vs UserListScreen
   - Creates uncertainty about which is current

2. **Unused/Archived Screens**:
   - RootNavigator imports old ManagerHomeScreen but doesn't use it
   - Code comments suggest screens are being incrementally re-enabled
   - Suggests temporary state that needs cleanup

3. **Image Asset Deletions**:
   - Git shows deleted logo files: artis-logo-transparent-dark.png, artis-logo.png, etc.
   - Two new logo files added: artislogo_blackbgrd.png, artislogo_whitebgrd.png
   - Rebranding in progress but not documented

## 9. CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

### Issues That Need Attention

1. **HIGH PRIORITY: Code Cleanup**
   - Remove unused ManagerHomeScreen.tsx (keep only ManagerHomeScreenSimple.tsx)
   - Remove unused TeamScreen variant
   - Update RootNavigator to remove commented-out unused screens
   - Clarify naming: either keep "_v2" or rename to current best practice

2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Documentation Accuracy**
   - Move DESIGN_REVAMP.md to archive (now implemented)
   - Move COMPLETE_NAVIGATION_PLAN.md to archive (now implemented)
   - Create DESIGN_SYSTEM_APPLICATION.md showing which screens have DS v0.1 applied
   - Create implementation docs for Offline Documents feature

3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Backend Gaps**
   - Verify getAccountDetails endpoint returns real data (not sample)
   - Implement top performers calculation properly
   - Consider expense approval workflow completion

4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Documentation Structure**
   - Create Architecture section with schema/API docs
   - Create Decisions section explaining StyleSheet workaround
   - Create Deployment section
   - Update README.md to reflect new structure

### Non-Issues (Working as Intended)

1. **Sample Data in Manager Dashboard**: Documented limitation, OK for MVP
2. **StyleSheet Workarounds**: Documented in code comments, performance acceptable
3. **Incremental Manager Screen Re-enablement**: Actually no longer incremental, all screens working
4. **Logo Asset Changes**: Part of ongoing design refresh, commit history shows progression
