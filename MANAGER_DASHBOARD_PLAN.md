## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Backend-first approach** - API design before UI made integration smooth
2. **Event-driven architecture** - Clean separation of concerns
3. **Design system** - Consistent theme made UI development faster
4. **TypeScript** - Caught many bugs early
5. **Incremental deployment** - Deployed functions as soon as ready

### What Could Be Better
1. **More testing** - Need automated tests for Cloud Functions
2. **Error handling** - Some edge cases not handled
3. **Performance monitoring** - No analytics/monitoring setup
4. **Documentation** - Could be more detailed

### What We'd Do Differently Next Time
1. **Set up automated tests from day 1** - Unit tests + integration tests
2. **Use Firebase emulators more** - Test locally before deploying
3. **Create component library first** - Build reusable components before screens
4. **Set up monitoring earlier** - Firebase Analytics + Crashlytics from start
