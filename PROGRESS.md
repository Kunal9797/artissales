## üîë Important Notes

### Firebase Project Details
- **Project ID**: `artis-sales-dev`
- **Firestore Location**: asia-south1 (Mumbai)
- **Storage Location**: us-central1 (will migrate to asia-south1 in prod)
- **Time Zone**: Asia/Kolkata (IST)
- **Auth Method**: Phone Number (with test numbers available)

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js 22, TypeScript)
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL, offline-first)
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth (Phone + JWT)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (for photos)
- **Notifications**: FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- **Scheduling**: Cloud Scheduler

### Data Model Key Points
- **Event-driven architecture**: All state changes emit events to `outbox_events`
- **SLA tracking**: 4-hour first-touch SLA for leads
- **Offline-first**: Firestore handles offline sync automatically
- **Phone normalization**: All phones stored as E.164 (+91XXXXXXXXXX)
- **GPS accuracy**: Max 100m for attendance, 50m for visits
- **Idempotency**: All write endpoints accept `requestId` for retry safety

### Known Issues
- Storage setup had UI error in Firebase Console (can enable via CLI later)
- Need to add SHA-1 fingerprint when Android app is created

---

## üìà Metrics to Track (Post-V1)

- **SLA Compliance**: >90% leads contacted within 4 hours
- **Attendance Accuracy**: GPS accuracy ‚â§ 100m for >95% check-ins
- **Offline Reliability**: 100% offline writes sync successfully
- **App Performance**: App launch < 2s, Firestore queries < 500ms
- **Manager Adoption**: >80% managers review DSRs within 24 hours
