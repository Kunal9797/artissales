### Performance Optimizations:
- FlashList for long lists (Accounts)
- FlatList with memoized renderItem for other lists
- Client-side search filtering (no API calls)
- Pull-to-refresh on all screens
- Lazy loading of detail screens

### Navigation Architecture:
- Role-based routing (managers → ManagerTabNavigator, reps → TabNavigator)
- Nested navigation (tabs + stack)
- Deep linking ready
- Back button handling
