## 🔑 Important Notes

### Firebase Project Details
- **Project ID**: `artis-sales-dev`
- **Firestore Location**: asia-south1 (Mumbai)
- **Storage Location**: us-central1 (will migrate to asia-south1 in prod)
- **Time Zone**: Asia/Kolkata (IST)
- **Auth Method**: Phone Number (with test numbers available)

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js 22, TypeScript)
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL, offline-first)
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth (Phone + JWT)
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage (for photos)
- **Notifications**: FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
- **Scheduling**: Cloud Scheduler

### Data Model Key Points
- **Event-driven architecture**: All state changes emit events to `outbox_events`
- **SLA tracking**: 4-hour first-touch SLA for leads
- **Offline-first**: Firestore handles offline sync automatically
- **Phone normalization**: All phones stored as E.164 (+91XXXXXXXXXX)
- **GPS accuracy**: Max 100m for attendance, 50m for visits
- **Idempotency**: All write endpoints accept `requestId` for retry safety

### Known Issues
- Storage setup had UI error in Firebase Console (can enable via CLI later)
- Need to add SHA-1 fingerprint when Android app is created

---

## 📈 Metrics to Track (Post-V1)

- **SLA Compliance**: >90% leads contacted within 4 hours
- **Attendance Accuracy**: GPS accuracy ≤ 100m for >95% check-ins
- **Offline Reliability**: 100% offline writes sync successfully
- **App Performance**: App launch < 2s, Firestore queries < 500ms
- **Manager Adoption**: >80% managers review DSRs within 24 hours

---

4. **🆕 Expense Reporting** - Sales reps log daily expenses (travel/food) with receipts
5. **🆕 Monthly Reports** - Managers view monthly stats: visits by type, sheets sold (requires dashboard work)
6. **🔮 Post-V1**: Sales incentive calculation (after verification workflow)

### Updated V1 Roadmap

- [ ] Create Expense entry screen

**Priority 3 - Manager Tools (Week 7)**
- [ ] Monthly reports aggregation (Cloud Function)
- [ ] Manager dashboard screens

**Deferred to Post-V1**
- Leads Module (SLA routing still needed, but lower priority than sales tracking)
- Sales incentive calculation

---

### October 10, 2025 - Morning Session (VISIT PHOTO FEATURE COMPLETE! 📸)

**Major Changes Implemented:**

1. **Backend Updates (All Deployed ✅)**
   - Added "architect" to AccountType enum ([functions/src/types/index.ts](functions/src/types/index.ts:38))
   - Updated Visit interface - removed `geo` & `accuracyM`, made `photos` required array
   - Added new types: `SheetsSale`, `Expense`, `CatalogType`, `ExpenseCategory`, `ExpenseStatus`
   - Updated Cloud Function [visits.ts](functions/src/api/visits.ts) - replaced GPS validation with photo validation
   - Requires minimum 1 photo URL, validates non-empty strings
   - **Deployed to production** - Live at us-central1-artis-sales-dev.cloudfunctions.net/logVisit

2. **Mobile App - Photo Capture System**
   - ✅ Created [storage.ts](mobile/src/services/storage.ts) - Firebase Storage upload service
     - Compresses images to 1024px width, 80% JPEG quality
     - Uploads to `visits/{userId}/{timestamp}.jpg`
     - Returns download URLs
   - ✅ Created [CameraCapture.tsx](mobile/src/components/CameraCapture.tsx) - Full-screen camera component
     - Requests camera permissions
     - Live photo capture (not from gallery)
     - Preview with Retake/Use Photo options
     - Clean, professional UI
   - ✅ Updated [LogVisitScreen.tsx](mobile/src/screens/visits/LogVisitScreen.tsx) - Complete rewrite
     - **Removed GPS tracking** (useLocation hook removed)
     - Added camera integration via modal
     - Photo preview before submission
     - Upload progress indicator
     - Shows "Architect" icon for architect accounts
     - Validates photo required before submit

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Updated V1 scope with new features
   - Added data models for `visits` (updated), `sheetsSales`, `expenses`
   - [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md) - This update

**Files Changed:**
- Backend: `functions/src/types/index.ts`, `functions/src/api/visits.ts`
- Mobile: `mobile/src/types/index.ts`, `mobile/src/services/storage.ts`, `mobile/src/components/CameraCapture.tsx`, `mobile/src/screens/visits/LogVisitScreen.tsx`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Testing Notes:**
- **Camera testing pending** - Requires real Android device (no device available currently)
- Camera functionality untested on emulator (emulator cameras unreliable)
- All other features (UI flow, validation, storage upload logic) implemented and ready
- **Next session**: Build APK and test on real device when available

**What Works (Should Work):**
- ✅ Photo capture UI and flow
- ✅ Photo compression before upload
- ✅ Firebase Storage upload
- ✅ Backend photo validation
- ✅ Visit submission with photo URL

**What Needs Real Device Testing:**
- ⚠️ expo-camera actual photo capture
- ⚠️ Photo quality on real camera
- ⚠️ Storage upload from device
- ⚠️ End-to-end visit logging with photo

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Current
