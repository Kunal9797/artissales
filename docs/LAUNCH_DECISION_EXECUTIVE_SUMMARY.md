## 💡 LEAD ENGINEER RECOMMENDATION

### **Ship Option B: Pragmatic V1**

**Reasoning**:

1. **Lead System is 0% Done**:
   - Webhook returns fake data
   - SLA escalator is empty
   - No mobile screens
   - No pincode routing data
   - Rushing this = high bug risk

2. **Expense Approval is 50% Done**:
   - Backend CRUD complete
   - Just need approval endpoints + 2 screens
   - Similar to DSR approval (proven pattern)
   - Low risk, 2 days work

3. **CSV Export is Nice-to-Have**:
   - Managers can screenshot or manual export
   - Not blocking daily operations
   - Can add in V1.1 quickly

4. **Quality Over Speed**:
   - Better to ship 7 polished features
   - Than 8 rushed features with bugs
   - Users prefer reliability

**V1 with Option B gives you**:
- Complete sales rep daily workflow
- Complete manager oversight (with expense approval)
- Offline-first reliability
- Professional UI/UX
- **Launch in 1 week**

**Then V1.1 (1-2 weeks later)**:
- Add lead routing with proper testing
- Add CSV export based on manager feedback
- Add any requested features from V1 user feedback
