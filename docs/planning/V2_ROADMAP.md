# V2 Roadmap - Future Enhancements

**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Timeline**: Post-V1 Launch

---

## üéØ Overview

This document tracks features and improvements planned for V2, after the initial V1 launch is complete and stable.

---

## üìã Code Quality & Refactoring

### 1. **Consolidate Account List Screens** ‚≠ê Priority
**Current State:**
- Two separate screens with ~90% duplicate code:
  - `SelectAccountScreen.tsx` (Sales Rep - for visit logging)
  - `AccountsListScreen.tsx` (Manager - for account management)

**Differences:**
| Feature | Sales Rep | Manager |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Click Action | ‚Üí Log Visit | ‚Üí Account Details |
| Filter Order | Dealers first, Distributors last | Distributors second |
| Can Create | Dealer/Architect/Contractor | All (including Distributor) |
| Visible Accounts | Future: Territory-based | All accounts |

**V2 Approach:**
Create shared `AccountsListView` component with role-based configuration:

```tsx
// Option 1: Role-based props
<AccountsListView
  mode={user.role === 'rep' ? 'select' : 'manage'}
  onAccountClick={handleAccountClick}
  filterConfig={getFilterConfig(user.role)}
  permissions={getPermissions(user.role)}
/>

// Option 2: Two thin wrapper components
// Core: <AccountsList /> (shared logic)
// Wrappers: <SelectAccountScreen />, <AccountsListScreen />
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth
- Easier maintenance
- Consistent behavior across roles
- Shared bug fixes

**Files to Refactor:**
- `mobile/src/screens/visits/SelectAccountScreen.tsx`
- `mobile/src/screens/manager/AccountsListScreen.tsx`
- Create: `mobile/src/components/AccountsListView.tsx`

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

## üîß Technical Improvements

  where('territory', '==', user.territory)
);
```

## üìù Notes

- Prioritize based on user feedback from V1
- Each feature should have a separate design doc
- Maintain backward compatibility with V1 data
- Plan migration strategy for breaking changes

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Gather user feedback from V1 launch
2. Prioritize features based on business impact
3. Create detailed design docs for top 3 features
4. Allocate engineering resources
