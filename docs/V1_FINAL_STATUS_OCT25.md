## üìä REVISED V1 SCOPE (Based on Clarifications)

### ‚úÖ INCLUDED IN V1

1. **Attendance** - 100% ‚úÖ
2. **Visit Logging** - 100% ‚úÖ (photo now mandatory in backend + mobile)
3. **Sheets Sales** - 100% ‚úÖ (all 4 catalogs, "Artis 1MM" naming)
4. **Expense Reporting** - 100% ‚úÖ (DSR handles approval)
5. **DSR Auto-Compile** - 100% ‚úÖ (includes expense approval via DSR)
6. **Manager Dashboard** - 95% ‚úÖ (CSV export deferred)
7. **Target Management** - 100% ‚úÖ
8. **Account Management** - 100% ‚úÖ
9. **User Management** - 100% ‚úÖ
10. **Document Library** - 100% ‚úÖ

### ‚ùå DEFERRED TO V2

1. **Lead Routing System** (0% implemented)
2. **CSV/PDF Export** (not started)
3. **Separate Expense Approval** (DSR approval sufficient for V1)

---

## üéØ REMAINING ITEMS FOR V1 LAUNCH

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. ~~Photo validation~~ ‚úÖ **DONE** (uncommitted and deployed)
2. ~~Dangerous functions~~ ‚úÖ **DONE** (removed and deployed)
3. ~~EAS build config~~ ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFERRED** (not needed until Play Store submission)

### High Priority (Recommended)
4. ‚è≥ **Rate limiting on all endpoints** (4 hours)
   - Currently: Only leadWebhook has rate limiting
   - Risk: DoS vulnerability
   - Impact: Could spam visits/sheets/expenses

5. ‚è≥ **NetInfo native module rebuild** (30 min)
   - Currently: Optional via try-catch
   - Impact: Offline detection won't work optimally
   - Fix: `npx expo prebuild && npx expo run:android`

6. ‚è≥ **Console log cleanup** (4-6 hours - optional)
   - Count: 169 statements across 42 files
   - Impact: Performance + security (info disclosure)
   - Can defer to V1.1

### Testing (With Android Phone)
7. ‚è≥ **Systematic testing** (3-4 days)
   - Day 1: Sales rep flows
   - Day 2: Manager flows
   - Day 3: Offline scenarios
   - Day 4: Edge cases + bug fixes

## üö® CLARIFICATIONS FROM DISCUSSION

### 1. Expense Approval
**Your Clarification**: "DSR is doing that (at least for V1)"

**Confirmed**: ‚úÖ Correct!
- DSR compiler aggregates daily expenses
- Manager approves DSR ‚Üí approves expenses included
- **No separate expense approval needed for V1**
- Removed from blockers list

### 2. Photo Validation
**Your Question**: "Didn't we just do this?"

**Answer**: We fixed it in **mobile** (LogVisitScreen.tsx) but it was still commented out in **backend** (visits.ts)
- **Fixed**: ‚úÖ Uncommented lines 66-75 and deployed
- **Status**: Now enforced on both mobile AND backend

### 3. Lead System
**Your Decision**: "Lead entire thing is left for V2"

**Confirmed**: ‚úÖ Removed from V1 scope entirely
- Webhook, SLA escalator, mobile screens all deferred
- Focus on sales tracking features

### 4. EAS Build
**Your Note**: "Can do in the end then"

**Confirmed**: ‚úÖ Not blocking development
- Only needed when submitting to Play Store
- Can configure before final submission

## üîç DANGEROUS FUNCTIONS - WHAT WAS REMOVED

### Removed from Production (Commented Out)
1. **`deleteAllAccounts`** - Deletes entire accounts collection üî•
2. **`seedAccounts`** - Adds sample data (pollutes database)
3. **`fixOct17Data`** - One-time data migration
4. **`fixAllPendingData`** - One-time data migration

### Kept with Admin Gatekeeping
5. **`createUser`** - ‚úÖ Now requires admin role
6. **`createNationalHeadUser`** - Keep for setup
7. **`updateRoleByPhone`** - Keep for emergency

### Kept for Debugging (Safe)
8. **`triggerDSRCompiler`** - Manual DSR trigger
9. **`checkPendingData`** - Read-only debug
10. **`checkPendingDSRs`** - Read-only debug
11. **`migrateToCustomClaims`** - One-time migration (run later)
12. **`syncStorageDocuments`** - Sync utility

**Result**: Most dangerous functions removed, emergency tools gated by admin role

## üí° WHAT ELSE OF CONCERN?

Based on comprehensive audit, here are **remaining concerns**:

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 1. Rate Limiting Missing (Security)
**Issue**: 36/37 endpoints have no rate limiting
**Risk**: Someone could:
- Spam visits to inflate stats
- Spam sheets sales
- DoS attack by overwhelming functions
**Fix Time**: 4 hours
**Recommendation**: Do this before launch

#### 2. Console Logs in Production (169 statements)
**Issue**: Debug logs in production build
**Risk**:
- Performance overhead (minor)
- Info disclosure (API responses logged)
**Fix Time**: 4-6 hours
**Recommendation**: Clean up or gate with `__DEV__`

#### 3. NetInfo Not Linked (Offline Detection)
**Issue**: Network detection doesn't work optimally
**Impact**: Upload queue can't detect offline state
**Current**: Falls back to always trying (works but not optimal)
**Fix Time**: 30 min rebuild
**Recommendation**: Do before launch

#### 4. No Automated Testing (0 tests)
**Issue**: Zero unit/integration/E2E tests
**Risk**: Unknown bugs will hit production
**Fix**: Not realistic before V1, but plan for V1.1
**Mitigation**: Systematic manual testing (you have Android phone now!)

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Can Ship With These)

#### 5. Top Performers Shows Mock Data
**Issue**: Manager dashboard has fake leaderboard
**Impact**: Low - can show disclaimer
**Fix**: Add "Sample data" label
**Or**: Hide card until V1.1

#### 6. ManagerHomeScreen StyleSheet Bug
**Issue**: Using "Simple" variant due to bug
**Impact**: None - Simple version works fine
**Fix**: Debug root cause (2-4 hours) or leave as-is

#### 7. TeamTargetsScreen Not Registered
**Issue**: Screen exists but not in navigation
**Impact**: None - SetTargetScreen covers functionality
**Fix**: Complete and register OR delete screen

3. ‚è≥ Systematic testing (3-4 days) - **QUALITY ASSURANCE**

**Optional** (Can defer to V1.1):
- Console log cleanup
- Top performers API
- ManagerHomeScreen bug fix
- TeamTargetsScreen completion

### **Timeline to Launch**:

**Minimum** (if skipping optional items):
- Rate limiting: 4 hours
- NetInfo rebuild: 30 min

**With polish**:
- Add console cleanup: +6 hours
- Add top performers fix: +4 hours
- **Total**: 6 days

## üöÄ WHAT TO DO NEXT?

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** - Should I add this to all endpoints now? (4 hours)
2. ‚úÖ **NetInfo rebuild** - Should I do this now? (30 min)
3. ‚úÖ **Testing checklist** - Should I create systematic test plan for your Android phone?

### This Week:
- Mon-Tue: Rate limiting + NetInfo + any other quick fixes
- Wed-Fri: You do systematic testing with Android phone
- Weekend: Fix bugs found
- Next Mon: Launch decision

**What do you want me to tackle next?** üöÄ
