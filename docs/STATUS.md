## 🔒 SECURITY (Complete)

### Security Audit (Oct 17, 2025)
- ✅ **Full-stack review**: 37 endpoints, 11 collections, storage rules
- ✅ **Threat modeling**: PII flows, role-based access, trust boundaries
- ✅ **Dependency audit**: 0 vulnerabilities (backend + mobile)
- ✅ **Secret scanning**: 0 leaked credentials
- ✅ **TypeScript validation**: 0 backend errors

### Critical Fixes Deployed
1. ✅ **Storage Rules**: Changed from public read to auth-required
   - Before: Anyone could download documents
   - After: Only authenticated users
   - File: `storage.rules:8`

2. ✅ **API Environment Variables**: Hardcoded dev URL → `.env` config
   - Before: Production builds hit dev backend
   - After: Dynamic URL based on environment
   - Files: `mobile/src/services/api.ts`, `mobile/.env.example`

3. ✅ **PII Redaction**: Phone/email exposed in logs → Redacted
   - Function: `redactPII()` masks sensitive data before logging
   - File: `mobile/src/services/api.ts:91-117`

4. ✅ **Error Details Sanitization**: Stack traces removed from auth errors
   - Before: Full Firebase error objects sent to client
   - After: Clean error messages, details logged server-side only
   - File: `functions/src/utils/auth.ts:38-45`

5. ✅ **Rate Limiting Infrastructure**: Verified exists in codebase
   - File: `functions/src/utils/rateLimiter.ts`
   - Status: Code ready, needs import to endpoints (P1 future work)

6. ✅ **Config Files**: `google-services.json` already in `.gitignore`

### Firestore Security Rules (RLS)
- ✅ 11 collections with role-based access control
- ✅ Helper functions: `isManager()`, `isRep()`, `isAdmin()`
- ✅ User-scoped reads (rep sees own data, manager sees team)
- ⚠️ **Known Issue**: `getUserRole()` performs extra Firestore read on every request
  - Impact: 2x read costs
  - Solution: Migrate to JWT custom claims (P0 future work)

### Firebase Deployment
- ✅ **Storage rules**: Deployed (auth required)
- ✅ **Firestore rules**: Re-deployed (no changes)
- ✅ **Cloud Functions**: 50+ functions deployed and ACTIVE

### Security Documentation

### Outstanding Security Work (P1/P2 - Not Blocking)
- ⏳ Migrate RLS to JWT custom claims (cost optimization, 2 days)
- ⏳ Apply rate limiters to all endpoints (DoS protection, 1 day)
- ⏳ Add CORS allowlist (CSRF prevention, 30 min)
