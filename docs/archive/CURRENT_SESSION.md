## 🎯 Current Focus

### Next Task: Add Pending Items to Stats Screen

**User Request**: "there is no space for the sales rep to see his pending expenses or sales data so maybe we can add that to the stats page"

**What's Needed**:
1. **Pending Expenses Section**
   - Show expense reports waiting for manager approval
   - Count of pending items
   - Status: "Waiting for approval"
   - Link to details (optional)

2. **Unverified Sheet Sales Section**
   - Show sheet sales awaiting verification
   - Count of unverified entries
   - Status: "Awaiting verification"
   - Important for incentive calculation

**Design**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📊 Stats                        │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Month Selector: October 2025] │
│                                 │
│ [Target Progress Card]          │
│ [Visit Progress Card]           │
│                                 │
│ Pending Approvals               │ ← NEW SECTION
│                                 │
│ 💰 2 Expense Reports            │
│    Waiting for approval         │
│                                 │
│ 📊 1 Sheet Sale                │
│    Awaiting verification        │
│                                 │
│ [Monthly KPI Cards]             │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add state for pending counts
2. Fetch pending expenses (status='pending')
3. Fetch unverified sheets (verified=false)
4. Create PendingApprovalsCard component
5. Add to StatsScreen below progress cards
6. Use feature colors (orange for expenses, purple for sheets)
7. Add pull-to-refresh support

---

## 🚀 After Pending Items

### Manager Dashboard Revamp

**Current Manager Screens** (9 screens):
1. ManagerHomeScreen.tsx - Team stats dashboard
2. UserListScreen.tsx - Team members
3. UserDetailScreen.tsx - Individual performance
4. AddUserScreen.tsx - Create new user
5. AccountsListScreen.tsx - Customer accounts
6. TeamTargetsScreen.tsx - Team targets
7. SetTargetScreen.tsx - Set individual target
8. DSRApprovalListScreen.tsx - Approve DSRs
9. DSRApprovalDetailScreen.tsx - Review specific DSR

**Current Navigation**:
- Single ManagerHomeScreen with menu cards
- Stack navigation to sub-screens
- No tabs (uses old card-based navigation)

**Modernization Options**:

**Option A: Manager TabNavigator** (Recommended)
- Similar to sales rep experience
- 5 tabs: Home | Team | Actions (FAB) | Approvals | Me
- Consistent navigation pattern
- Modern and familiar

**Option B: Keep Single Screen**
- Modernize ManagerHomeScreen layout
- Apply DS v0.1 components
- Keep card-based navigation
- Simpler to implement

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Modern HomeScreen with sections
- Bottom action bar (not tabs)
- Quick access to common actions
- Middle ground approach

**Decision Needed**: Which option to pursue?
