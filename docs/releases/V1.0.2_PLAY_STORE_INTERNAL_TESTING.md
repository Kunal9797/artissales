## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/mobile/eas.json`
**Changed:**
```json
"production": {
  "android": {
    "buildType": "apk"  // OLD
  }
}
```

**To:**
```json
"production": {
  "android": {
    "buildType": "app-bundle"  // NEW - Required for Play Store
  }
}
```

**Why:** Play Store requires AAB format instead of APK for distribution. AABs enable:
- Smaller download sizes for users (Play Store generates optimized APKs)
- Better resource optimization
- Required for Play Store submission
