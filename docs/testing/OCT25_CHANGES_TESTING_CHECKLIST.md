## üìã TESTING PRIORITY ORDER

### **TEST 1: Visit Logging with Optimistic Updates** ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**What Changed**:
- Background photo upload
- Instant navigation (no waiting 5-30 seconds)
- "Syncing..." indicator

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Go to Home ‚Üí Activities ‚Üí Log Visit
2. [ ] Select any account
3. [ ] Take a photo with camera
4. [ ] Select purpose (e.g., "Follow Up")

### **TEST 2: Photo Validation (Backend Now Enforces)** ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**What Changed**: Backend now REQUIRES photo (was commented out before)

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Try to submit visit WITHOUT taking photo

**Expected**:
- ‚úÖ Mobile should block with: "Please take a photo of the counter"
- ‚úÖ If somehow bypassing mobile, backend should return error

**Why This Matters**: Photo is V1 requirement - must be enforced

---

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Go to any existing visit
2. [ ] Tap to edit

2. [ ] **Stats Screen**: View monthly stats ‚Üí Sheets breakdown should show "Artis 1MM"
3. [ ] **DSR Screen**: View today's DSR ‚Üí Should show "Artis 1MM"
4. [ ] **Set Target Screen** (Manager): Should have "Artis 1MM" option

**Expected**:

- ‚úÖ Old data still displays correctly (display mapper handles it)
- ‚úÖ New entries saved as "Artis 1MM"

---

### **TEST 6: Role Restrictions in Add User** ‚≠ê MEDIUM

**Steps** (requires logging in as national_head):
1. [ ] Log in as national_head role
2. [ ] Go to Team ‚Üí Add User (+ button)
3. [ ] Look at role options

---

### **TEST 8: Offline Sync (Background Upload)** ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**What Changed**: New upload queue with offline support

**Steps**:
1. [ ] Log a visit with photo
2. [ ] Navigate away immediately (should be instant)
3. [ ] Turn on Airplane Mode before photo finishes uploading
4. [ ] Check if "Syncing..." badge persists
5. [ ] Turn off Airplane Mode

---

## üß™ TESTING NOTES

### If Something Breaks:

**Visit submission doesn't work**:
- Check console for upload queue errors
- Verify photo validation isn't blocking incorrectly
- Check backend logs

**Scrolling is choppy**:
- FlashList might need estimatedItemSize tuning
- Report which screen

**"Artis 1MM" not showing**:
- Might be old cached data
- Pull to refresh
- Clear app data and re-login

**App crashes on certain screen**:
- Note which screen
- Check console error
- Probably a logger import issue in that file

---

## ‚úÖ QUICK TEST (5 Minutes)

If you just want to verify nothing broke:

1. [ ] Login
2. [ ] Check-in
3. [ ] Log one visit with photo (test optimistic update!)
4. [ ] Log sheets for "Artis 1MM" (test catalog rename!)
5. [ ] Check stats
6. [ ] Check-out

If all 6 steps work, app is stable! ‚úÖ
