# Data Flow & Event-Driven Architecture

**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025
**Pattern**: Event-Driven with Outbox Pattern

---

## Overview

The Artis Sales App uses an **event-driven architecture** where all significant state changes emit domain events. This enables:
- **Loose coupling** between components
- **Auditability** with complete event logs
- **Reliability** through automatic retries
- **Extensibility** for future features

---

## Core Pattern: Outbox + Event Processing

```
1. Action occurs (e.g., Visit logged)
   â†“
2. Write to primary collection (visits)
   â†“
3. Write event to 'events' collection (outbox)
   â†“
4. Scheduled function polls outbox (every 30s)
   â†“
5. Process unprocessed events
   â†“
6. Send notifications, update stats
   â†“
7. Mark event as processed
```

### Why Outbox Pattern?
- **Reliability**: Events never lost (stored in Firestore)
- **Retry**: Failed events automatically retried
- **Order**: Events processed in order
- **Idempotency**: Same event won't cause duplicate side effects

---

## Event Types

```typescript
type EventType =
  | "LeadCreated"          // New lead from website
  | "LeadAssigned"         // Lead assigned to rep
  | "LeadSLAExpired"       // Lead not contacted within 4 hours
  | "VisitStarted"         // Visit logged (deprecated - instant now)
  | "VisitEnded"           // Visit completed
  | "AttendanceCheckedIn"  // Rep checked in
  | "AttendanceCheckedOut" // Rep checked out
```

### 6. Lead Routing Flow (Future)

```
[Website Form]

  {
    name: "Anita Desai",
    phone: "9876543210",
    pincode: "110001",
    message: "Interested in laminates"
  }
  â†“
POST /webhooks/lead (webhook endpoint)
  â†“
[Cloud Function]
Normalize phone: "+919876543210"
  â†“
Check duplicate (query 'leads' by phone)
  â†“
If duplicate: Return existing lead
  â†“
Lookup pincode routing
  Query 'pincodeRoutes' where pincode = "110001"
  â†“
Get assigned rep: repUserId = "rep456"
  â†“
Create lead
  {
    ownerUserId: "rep456",
    status: "new",
    slaDueAt: now() + 4 hours,
    assignmentHistory: [{
      userId: "rep456",
      assignedAt: now(),
      reason: "initial"
    }]
  }
  â†“
Create events
  1. LeadCreated event
  2. LeadAssigned event
  â†“
Return response
  â†“
[Scheduled Function: outboxProcessor]
  â†“
Process "LeadCreated"
  â†’ Log to analytics
  â†“
Process "LeadAssigned"
  â†’ Send FCM to rep456
    "New lead assigned: Anita Desai in Delhi"
  â†“
Mark events as processed
  â†“
[Scheduled Function: slaEscalator]
(runs every 5 minutes)
  â†“
Query overdue leads
  WHERE status = "new" AND slaDueAt < now()
  â†“
For each overdue lead:
  â†“
  Get backup rep from pincodeRoutes
  â†“
  Update lead
    {
      ownerUserId: "backupRep789",
      slaDueAt: now() + 4 hours,
      slaBreached: true,
      assignmentHistory: [
        ...old,
        {
          userId: "backupRep789",
          assignedAt: now(),
          reason: "sla_expired"
        }
      ]
    }
  â†“
  Create events
    1. LeadSLAExpired
    2. LeadAssigned (to backup rep)
  â†“
  Send FCM to original rep
    "Lead SLA expired - reassigned to backup"
  â†“
  Send FCM to manager
    "Lead SLA breach - Rep didn't contact in 4 hours"
```

## Offline Behavior

### Write Operations (Offline)

```
[Mobile App - Offline]
User logs visit
  â†“
Write to local Firestore cache
  {
    visitId: "temp-visit-123",  // Temporary ID
    ...visitData,
    _pending: true  // Internal flag
  }
  â†“
Show success message
  "Visit logged (will sync when online)"
  â†“
UI shows pending indicator
  â†“
[Mobile App - Comes Online]
Firestore SDK detects connectivity
  â†“
Automatically syncs pending writes
  â†“
Temporary ID replaced with server ID
  â†“
UI updates to show synced state
  â†“
[Cloud Function]
Receives synced write
  â†“
Processes normally (events, updates, etc.)
```

### Read Operations (Offline)

```
[Mobile App - Offline]
User opens visit history
  â†“
Query local Firestore cache
  â†“
Return cached data
  â†“
Show data with "Offline" indicator
  â†“
[Mobile App - Comes Online]
Firestore SDK syncs latest data
  â†“
Cache updated automatically
  â†“
UI refreshes with latest data
  â†“
"Offline" indicator removed
```

## Error Handling & Retries

### Event Processing Errors

```
[Scheduled Function: outboxProcessor]
Fetch unprocessed events
  â†“
For each event:
  â†“
  Try to process
  â†“
  If success:
    â†’ Mark as processed
    â†’ Set processedAt timestamp
  â†“
  If error:
    â†’ Increment retryCount
    â†’ Store error message
    â†’ Leave processedAt null
  â†“
Next run (30s later):
  â†“
  Retry unprocessed events
  â†“
  If retryCount > 5:
    â†’ Log critical error
    â†’ Alert admin
    â†’ Mark as failed (stop retrying)
```

### API Request Errors

```
[Mobile App]
POST /api/visits
  â†“
[Cloud Function]
Network error / Timeout
  â†“
[Mobile App]
Catches error
  â†“
Shows retry dialog
  "Failed to log visit. Retry?"
  â†“
User taps "Retry"
  â†“
Retry request
  â†“
If success: Show success
If fail after 3 retries:
  â†’ Show "Try again later"
  â†’ Data remains in local queue
  â†’ Will sync when connectivity restored
```

---

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Denormalization

**Why**: Avoid expensive joins in NoSQL

**Example**: Visit stores account name
```typescript
// Instead of querying accounts collection every time
{
  accountId: "acc789",
  accountName: "Sharma Laminates",  // Denormalized
  accountType: "dealer"
}
```

### 2. Caching

**Firestore Persistence**: Enabled on mobile
- First load: Query server
- Subsequent loads: Serve from cache
- Background: Sync latest data

### 3. Batching

**Example**: Update multiple targets in one batch
```typescript
const batch = firestore().batch();
batch.update(target1Ref, {sheetsSold: 50});
batch.update(target2Ref, {sheetsSold: 30});
await batch.commit();  // Single network round-trip
```
