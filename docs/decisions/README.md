## Purpose

Design decisions capture:
- **Context**: What was the situation?
- **Decision**: What did we choose?
- **Rationale**: Why did we choose it?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?
- **Alternatives**: What else did we consider?
- **Date**: When was this decided?

## How to Use

### For Developers
- Read relevant decision before modifying related code
- Reference decisions in PR descriptions
- Update decision if context changes

### For AI Agents
- Read decisions to understand "why" not just "what"
- Follow patterns established in decisions
- Don't repeat evaluated alternatives

### Adding New Decisions
1. Create `NNN_DECISION_TOPIC.md` (increment number)
2. Use template below
3. Update this README with link
4. Reference in related code/docs
