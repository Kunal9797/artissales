**Title:** `perf(list): migrate AccountsListScreen to FlashList (PR5)`

**Base Branch:** `main`
**Head Branch:** `feature/ds-v0.1`
**Commit:** f587ac8

## Summary
Migrated AccountsListScreen from FlatList to @shopify/flash-list for better performance on large account lists.

## Changes
- âœ… Replaced `FlatList` with `FlashList` from @shopify/flash-list
- âœ… Set `estimatedItemSize=64` (account card height â‰ˆ 48px icon + 16px padding)
- âœ… Removed redundant perf props (windowSize, maxToRenderPerBatch, etc.)
- âœ… Kept all memoization (renderItem, keyExtractor)
- âœ… **No UX changes:** FiltersBar, Empty/Error/Skeleton patterns intact

## Benefits
- Better memory efficiency via cell recycling (similar to RecyclerView)
- Improved scroll performance for 50+ accounts
- Simpler API, less configuration needed
- Native-like list behavior

## Files Changed
- `src/screens/manager/AccountsListScreen.tsx` - FlatList â†’ FlashList
- `package.json` - Added @shopify/flash-list dependency
- `docs/PR5_FLASHLIST_PERF.md` - Before/after comparison, migration pattern, testing checklist
